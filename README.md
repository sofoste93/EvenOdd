# EASY METHOD:
To execute the program directly:
- run the file EvenOdd.bat (.BAT-File)
- this will execute the program with CMD on the Windows Platform

# ADVANCED METHOD:
To execute the program manually into the terminal:
- open the Windows terminal
- now change the directory to get where the .jar-file is stored
- type the command: java -jar EnvenOdd.jar and hit ENTER

You can also execute the program using and designed editor.
